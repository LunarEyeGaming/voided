Lightning sound effect (/sfx/weather/v_lightning_strike2.ogg) by NoiseNoir on Freesound.org. Applied noise reduction with fade out and trimmed.

All custom sounds were made in Audacity using vanilla Starbound's assets, except for the aforementioned lightning sound effect.

I would like to thank Portal Mech for playtesting the current mission and providing feedback and ideas for it.

I would also like to thank the members on the Starbound Discord for their feedback and advice.
