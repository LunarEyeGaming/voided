Lightning sound effects:
1. /sfx/weather/v_lightning_strike.ogg: by Turrus on Freesound.org. Trimmed with fade-out applied at the end.
1. /sfx/weather/v_lightning_strike2.ogg: by NoiseNoir on Freesound.org. Applied noise reduction with fade out and trimmed.
1. /sfx/weather/v_lightning_strike3.ogg: by Ambientsoundapp on Freesound.org. Amplified and trimmed with fade out.

All custom sounds were made in Audacity using vanilla Starbound's assets, except for the aforementioned lightning sound effects.

I would like to thank Portal Mech for playtesting the current mission and providing feedback and ideas for it.

I would also like to thank the members on the Starbound Discord for their feedback and advice.
