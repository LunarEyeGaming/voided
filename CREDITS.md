Lightning sound effects:
1. /sfx/weather/v_lightning_strike.ogg: "Lightning Strike" by Turrus on Freesound.org (URL: https://freesound.org/people/Turrus/sounds/242048/). Trimmed with fade-out applied at the end.
1. /sfx/weather/v_lightning_strike2.ogg: "LightningCrash.wav" by NoiseNoir on Freesound.org (URL: https://freesound.org/people/NoiseNoir/sounds/238302/). Applied noise reduction with fade out and trimmed.
1. /sfx/weather/v_lightning_strike3.ogg: "Lightning Storm.wav" by Ambientsoundapp on Freesound.org (URL: https://freesound.org/people/Ambientsoundapp/sounds/537985/). Amplified and trimmed with fade out.

All custom sounds were made in Audacity using vanilla Starbound's assets, except for the aforementioned lightning sound effects.

I would like to thank Portal Mech for playtesting the Ancient Stronghold and the Voltage biome and providing feedback and ideas for them.

I would also like to thank the members on the Starbound Discord for their feedback, advice, and ideas.
