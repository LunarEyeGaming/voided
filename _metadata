  "description" : "Extended Story, rethought from the ground up\n\n^blue;WARNINGS^reset;\nThis mod contains flashing lights and other content that may cause discomfort in people with photosensitive epilepsy.\nThis mod will also permanently alter your players and universe. It is recommended that you backup your storage folder (usually found at C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\Starbound\\storage on Windows, ~/.steam/steam/SteamApps/common/Starbound/storage or ~/.local/share/Steam/SteamApps/common/Starbound/storage on Linux)\nThis mod is completely untested in multiplayer; expect a lot of bugs during your experience.\n\n^blue;DESCRIPTION^reset;\nVoided: Expansion Mod (or simply Voided) is the Extended Story Mod rethought from the ground up. It focuses on adding post-game content to the game, but it is currently a work in progress and only features one dungeon: The Ancient Stronghold. This mod is designed to be primarily a single player experience, but I will note and attempt to fix multiplayer-related bugs. In the far future, it aims to add seven new biomes and some content associated with those biomes.\n\nFeatures:\n\n* A new mission: The Ancient Stronghold\n* A new and challenging boss encounter\n* Ancient weapons and armor (with a new set bonus), all with a new rarity\n* More to come at a later date!\n\n\n^blue;GETTING STARTED^reset;\nSince this mod is intended to be post-game, it is recommended that you use an existing tier 6 character. To access the Ancient Stronghold, you must find and unlock its entrance on a Lava planet.\n\n^blue;COMPATIBILITY^reset;\nNo known conflicts have been encountered with Voided. However, it includes support for More Planet Info.\n\nIt is compatible with Frackin' Universe and Extended Story.\n\n^blue;CREDITS^reset;\nAll custom sounds were made in Audacity using vanilla Starbound's assets\n\nI would like to thank Portal Mech for playtesting the current mission and providing feedback and ideas for it.\n\nAdditional mods used in screenshots: Frackin' Interface, Stardust Core Lite, Improved Damage Particles, Stack Enlarger SE, Better (C) Pick Ups, Better Action Bar & Icons, Refined Cursors\n\n^blue;FEEDBACK^reset;\nFeedback describing how your experience was overall will be greatly appreciated. All feedback is to be posted in the dedicated \"Feedback\" discussion below.\n\nPlease report all bugs you encounter in the dedicated \"Bug Reports\" discussion below. I especially encourage you to report any multiplayer-related bugs.\n\n^blue;LINKS^reset;\nNon-Steam Version: https://community.playstarbound.com/resources/voided-expansion-mod-wip.6197/\nGitHub Repository: https://github.com/LunarEyeGaming/voided\nKnown Bugs: https://docs.google.com/document/d/12hKIdRh1bbR0lIanLV6dGeMau6f87U44kCKRmzF6plM/edit?usp=sharing",
