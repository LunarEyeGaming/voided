It focuses on adding post-game content to the game, but it is currently a work in progress and only features one dungeon: The Ancient Stronghold. This mod is designed to be primarily a single player experience, but I will note and attempt to fix multiplayer-related bugs. In the far future, it aims to add seven new biomes and some content associated with those biomes.\n\nTo access the Ancient Stronghold, you must find and unlock its entrance on a Magma planet.\n\nFeatures:\nA new mission: The Ancient Stronghold\nA new and challenging boss encounter\nAncient weapons and armor (with a new set bonus), all with a new rarity\nMore to come at a later date!\n\n^blue;COMPATIBILITY^reset;\n\nNo known conflicts have been encountered with Voided. However, it includes support for More Planet Info.\n\nIt is compatible with Frackin' Universe.\n\n^blue;CREDITS^reset;\n\nAll custom sounds were made in Audacity using vanilla Starbound's assets\n\nI would like to thank Portal Mech for playtesting the current mission and providing feedback and ideas for it.\n\n^blue;FEEDBACK^reset;\n\nFeedback describing how your experience was overall will be greatly appreciated.
