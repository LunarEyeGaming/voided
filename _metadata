  "description" : "Extended Story, rethought from the ground up\n\n^blue;WARNINGS^reset;\nThis mod contains flashing lights and other content that may cause discomfort in people with photosensitive epilepsy.\nThis mod will also permanently alter your players and universe. It is recommended that you backup your storage folder (usually found at C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\Starbound\\storage on Windows, ~/.steam/steam/SteamApps/common/Starbound/storage or ~/.local/share/Steam/SteamApps/common/Starbound/storage on Linux)\n\n^blue;NOTICE^reset;\nVoided requires TerraLib to function properly. You can find on the Steam Workshop here: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2230165463 or on Chucklefish Forums here: https://community.playstarbound.com/resources/terralib.6055/. Alternatively, you may search for \"terralib\" on either of the aforementioned sites.\n\n^blue;DESCRIPTION^reset;\nVoided: Expansion Mod (or simply Voided) is the Extended Story Mod rethought from the ground up. All of Extended Story's post-game content (particularly the elemental biomes, the Bossvault, and the Supervoid) will be reworked with emphasis placed on the exploration of planetary biomes and challenging combat encounters. In addition, the main antagonist of Voided will (eventually) have a clearer presence than in Extended Story. It is currently a work in progress and only features the Ancient Stronghold as well as the Voltage and Toxic Wasteland biomes. In the far future, it aims to add seven new biomes and some content associated with those biomes.\n\nThis mod is designed to be primarily a single player experience, but I will note and attempt to fix multiplayer-related bugs.\n\nFeatures:\n\n* Two new missions: The Ancient Stronghold and the Electrochem Facility\n* Two new and challenging boss encounters\n* Ancient weapons and armor (with a new set bonus), all with a new rarity\n* The Voltage and Toxic Wasteland planet types as well as unique equipment you can get from them.\n* Two new dungeons you can find near the cores of Voltage worlds and Toxic Wasteland worlds respectively, each with a miniboss at the end.\n* More to come at a later date!\n\nNote: Every biome and mission added by Voided gives vanilla healing items cooldowns (15 seconds for medkits; 30 seconds for nanowraps and bandages). This choice was made to make Voided's combat encounters more challenging but fair.\n\n^blue;GETTING STARTED^reset;\nSince this mod is intended to be post-game, it is recommended that you use an existing tier 6 character. To access the Ancient Stronghold, you must find and unlock its entrance at the edge of an Outsider Star system. Note: You do not need to beat the main story in order to access it.\nI recommend turning on Tutorial Messages in the Options menu because Voided adds some tutorial radio messages for the Voltage and Toxic Wasteland biomes.\n\n^blue;COMPATIBILITY^reset;\nVoided includes support for More Planet Info, Book of Spirits, the Recipe Browser mod, and the Spawnable Item Packs mod.\n\nIt is compatible with Frackin' Universe and Extended Story.\n\nSupper's Combat Overhaul causes issues with some of the enemies in Voided, especially bosses.\n\nThis mod uses the prefix \"v-\" in all of its IDs.\n\n^blue;CREDITS^reset;\nAll custom sounds in Voided were made in Audacity using Starbound's assets and/or the following sound samples:\n* \"Lightning Strike\" by Turrus on Freesound.org (URL: https://freesound.org/people/Turrus/sounds/242048/).\n* \"LightningCrash.wav\" by NoiseNoir on Freesound.org (URL: https://freesound.org/people/NoiseNoir/sounds/238302/).
