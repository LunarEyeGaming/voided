  "description" : "A work-in-progress post-game expansion surrounding an odd, dark star\n\n^blue;WARNINGS^reset;\nThis mod contains flashing lights and other content that may cause discomfort in people with photosensitive epilepsy.\nThis mod will also permanently alter your players and universe. It is recommended that you backup your storage folder before downloading this mod (usually found at C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\Starbound\\storage on Windows, ~/.steam/steam/SteamApps/common/Starbound/storage or ~/.local/share/Steam/SteamApps/common/Starbound/storage on Linux).\n\n^blue;INTRODUCTION^reset;\n^gray;A new star type known as the Outsider Star has manifested itself within the darkest reaches of the universe. This peculiar star is home to a variety of element-themed planets, each one bearing its own host of hazards and fauna ready to end you in an instant. What secrets will you find on your way to the bottom, and more importantly, will you live through your discoveries?^reset;\n\nVoided: Expansion Mod (or simply \"Voided\") is a complete reimagining of Extended Story focused on the post-game content that it offers.\n\n^blue;FEATURES^reset;\nWithin a post-game expansion...\n* Endure brutally dangerous worlds themed around the four elements.\n* Discover a variety of environments--some beautiful, some terrifying, and some chaotic.\n* Fight challenging adversaries.\n* Craft an arsenal of weapons and armor.\n\n^blue;What is yet to be added?^reset;\nThis mod is currently a work in progress, so not all features have been added yet.\n\nIn the future, there will be:\n* A dungeon and miniboss in the Ministar.\n* The ice planet type and its corresponding dungeon.\n* A boss battle themed around fire and ice.\n* A final planet type as well as a final boss.\n\n^blue;GETTING STARTED^reset;\nSince this mod is intended to be post-game, I recommend that you use an existing tier 6 character or, if you don't have one and don't want to play through the main game, that you cheat in some tier 6 gear. You don't need to beat the main story to start Voided.\n\nAfter doing that, all you need to do now is go to an Outsider Star system and start exploring!\n\nNote: Voided **requires** TerraLib and tileBroken Workaround to function properly, and I recommend installing Buoyant Items as well (a few sections of Voided include ocean-based hazards).\n\n^blue;COMPATIBILITY^reset;\nSupported Mods:\n* More Planet Info\n* Book of Spirits\n* Planet Search\n* Galactic Almanach\n* Recipe Browser\n* Spawnable Item Pack\n* FutaraDragon's Fullbright Shader\n\nIt is compatible with Frackin' Universe and Extended Story.\n\nSupper's Combat Overhaul causes issues with some of the enemies in Voided, especially bosses.\n\nIf you know of any other mod incompatibilities, please contact me through the Discord server linked below or make a post in the thread associated with this mod.\n\n^blue;CREDITS^reset;\n^blue;Music & Sounds^reset;\nAll custom sounds in Voided were made in Audacity using Starbound's assets and/or the following sound samples:\n* \"Lightning Strike\" by Turrus on Freesound.org.
