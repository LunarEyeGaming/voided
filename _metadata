  "description" : "Extended Story, rethought from the ground up\n\n^blue;WARNINGS^reset;\nThis mod contains flashing lights and other content that may cause discomfort in people with photosensitive epilepsy.\nThis mod will also permanently alter your players and universe. It is recommended that you backup your storage folder (usually found at C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\Starbound\\storage on Windows, ~/.steam/steam/SteamApps/common/Starbound/storage or ~/.local/share/Steam/SteamApps/common/Starbound/storage on Linux)\n\n^blue;THE VOLTAGE UPDATE IS OUT^reset;\nThis update adds one new planet type: Voltage. You can find Voltage worlds orbiting Extradimensional (purple) stars. On these worlds, you can find unique biomes all the way from the surface to the core! As of version 0.2.1, you can also find a unique dungeon at the core of Voltage worlds.\n\n^blue;DESCRIPTION^reset;\nVoided: Expansion Mod (or simply Voided) is the Extended Story Mod rethought from the ground up. It focuses on adding post-game content to the game, but it is currently a work in progress and only features the Ancient Stronghold as well as the Voltage biome. This mod is designed to be primarily a single player experience, but I will note and attempt to fix multiplayer-related bugs. In the far future, it aims to add seven new biomes and some content associated with those biomes.\n\nFeatures:\n\n* A new mission: The Ancient Stronghold\n* A new and challenging boss encounter\n* Ancient weapons and armor (with a new set bonus), all with a new rarity\n* Voltage planet types as well as unique equipment you can get from it.\n* A new dungeon you can find at the core of Voltage worlds.\n* More to come at a later date!\n\n\n^blue;GETTING STARTED^reset;\nSince this mod is intended to be post-game, it is recommended that you use an existing tier 6 character. To access the Ancient Stronghold, you must find and unlock its entrance at the edge of an Outsider Star system. Note: You do not need to beat the main story in order to access it.\n\n^blue;COMPATIBILITY^reset;\nSupper's Combat Overhaul causes issues with some of the enemies in Voided, especially bosses. However, it includes support for More Planet Info.\n\nIt is compatible with Frackin' Universe and Extended Story.\n\nThis mod uses the prefix \"v-\" in all of its IDs.\n\n^blue;CREDITS^reset;\nLightning sound effects:\n1. /sfx/weather/v_lightning_strike.ogg: \"Lightning Strike\" by Turrus on Freesound.org (URL: https://freesound.org/people/Turrus/sounds/242048/).
