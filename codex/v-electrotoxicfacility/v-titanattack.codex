    "As of the time that I am writing this, L&P is no more. The lab and the city were brought to ruins. Most of the workers, including emergency personnel, who were in either building were killed. The damage was extensive enough to drive L&P into bankruptcy. No material assets will be liquified, and no investigation into the disaster will be made. The executives have no intent on coming back to this place. Not while that ^#e000d5;thing^reset; is still around."
