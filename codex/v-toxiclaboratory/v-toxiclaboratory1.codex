    "^yellow;MOTIVATION^reset;

Past experiments have shown that the mushrooms infesting the core of the Toxic Wasteland can thrive in a variety of environments. We have also recently observed that Pulpins are remarkably resilient to their mycotoxins, so combining the adaptability of these mushrooms with the Pulpins' ability to ambush unsuspecting victims could produce effective bioweapons.",

    "^yellow;HYPOTHESIS^reset;

If a Pulpin is injected with Toxic Wasteland mushroom tissue samples, then it can grow and sustain a colony of this kind of fungus.

^yellow;METHODS^reset;

Inject a Pulpin with stem cells from Toxic Wasteland mushrooms. Keep in the lab for several weeks and record observations.",

    "^yellow;RESULTS^reset;

Subject has bloated to approximately eight times its usual volume and has developed mushroom growths on its head. It has also become far more dangerous, gaining the ability to violently erupt spines out of the ground. This is at the cost of its mobility as it has become permanently rooted to the ground.",

    "^yellow;DISCUSSION^reset;

These results prove to be far more dangerous than expected, although its tendency to root itself into the ground makes it too difficult to deploy efficiently in its current state. Further research in this area may attempt to get around this issue.
