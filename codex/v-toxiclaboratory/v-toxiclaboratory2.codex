    "^yellow;MOTIVATION^reset;

Experiment #65 has yielded promising results regarding the empowering of Pulpins via Toxic Wasteland fungi. We have decided to continue this research along the second path proposed in Experiment #65, namely experimenting on other monsters. This brings us to the Poptop, a creature known for the terror it brings.",

    "^yellow;HYPOTHESIS^reset;

If a Poptop is injected with Toxic Wasteland mushroom tissue samples, then it can grow and sustain a colony of this kind of fungus, making it scarier.

^yellow;METHODS^reset;

Inject a Poptop with stem cells from Toxic Wasteland mushrooms. Keep in the lab for several weeks and record observations.",

    "^yellow;RESULTS^reset;

Subject has melted into an adhesive goop with fungi having taken over its entire body. Consequently, it is unable to move. Subject has also gained the ability to discharge explosive spores.",

    "^yellow;DISCUSSION^reset;

Like Experiment #65, this experiment shows significant potential in the production of bioweapons. Future research similarly may attempt to work around this issue.
