    "A request has been made from the higher-ups to discontinue research into empowering creatures using Toxic Wasteland fungi and to divert funds to the ^orange;100-LG^reset; project. It's sad to see this research meet its end. The Adult Poptop in particular was showing great potential with its sheer power since its transformation. I'll have to figure out how to deliver this news to my employees. They were as passionate about this project as I was."
