This project is a reworked version of Extended Story. The only content so far is the "Ancient Stronghold", the Voltage biome and the Toxic Wasteland biome. 

Your hint as to how to access the Ancient Stronghold is: Go to an Outsider Star.

Alternatively, you can just enter `/warp instanceworld:v-ancientstronghold` into the console, but I recommend trying to follow the above hint first.

The Voltage biome is accessible through the Outsider Star systems, or through `/warp instanceworld:v-voltagetest`.

The Toxic Wasteland biome is accessible through `/warp instanceworld:v-toxicwastelandtest`. The ID for the EPP is `v-poisonprotectionback`
