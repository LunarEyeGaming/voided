This project is a reworked version of Extended Story. The only content so far is the "Ancient Stronghold" and the Voltage biome. 

Your hint as to how to access the Ancient Stronghold is: Explore the surface of Magma planets.

Alternatively, you can just enter `/warp instanceworld:v-ancientstronghold` into the console, but I recommend trying to follow the above hint first.

The Voltage biome is accessible through the Extradimensional Star systems, or through `/warp instanceworld:v-voltagetest`.
