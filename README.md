**Notice: versions of Voided downloaded directly from the GitHub repository (instead of through the Releases section of the repository) are likely to be "unstable" versions, meaning some of the content they contain is in active development and therefore subject to change. In addition, changes that could lead to save corruption may be made to work-in-progress content. Play these unstable versions at your own risk.**

This project is a reworked version of Extended Story. The only content so far is the "Ancient Stronghold", the Voltage biome and the Toxic Wasteland biome (WIP). Please see the [workshop description](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=2822921122) or the [Chucklefish Forums description](https://community.playstarbound.com/resources/voided-expansion-mod-wip.6197/) for more details.

Your hint as to how to access the Ancient Stronghold is: Go to an Outsider Star.

Alternatively, you can just enter `/warp instanceworld:v-ancientstronghold` into the console, but I recommend trying to follow the above hint first.

The Voltage biome is accessible through the Outsider Star systems, or through `/warp instanceworld:v-voltagetest`.

The Toxic Wasteland biome is accessible through `/warp instanceworld:v-toxicwastelandtest`. The ID for the EPP is `v-poisonprotectionback`

Credits are given in [CREDITS.md](CREDITS.md). This document also includes credits for content present in the unstable versions of Voided.
